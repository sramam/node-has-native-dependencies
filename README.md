# node-has-native-dependencies
A simple command line utility to check where a node-module has native dependencies

This does a rather brute-force dependency check that there are no installed node_modules
that have a 'bindings.gyp' file within. 'bindings.gyp' is a telltale sign of a module
with native dependencies.

# Installation
```bash
npm install node-has-native-dependencies
```

# Usage
## As a library
```js
const hasNativeDeps = require('node-has-native-dependencies')
hasNativeDeps();
```

If you want to control which directory to scan
```js
hasNativeDeps(some_dir_path)
```

## From the command line
```bash
./node_modules/.bin/node-has-native-dependencies
```
